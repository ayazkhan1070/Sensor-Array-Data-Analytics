The objective of this task is to discriminate the target gas(ethanol in our case) from all our gases present in a certain mixture of gases and find the optimized method among the three methods i.e; stepwise elimination method, Wilkâ€™s lambda method and B4(technique based on principal component analysis) to clearly distinguish the target gas among all gases present.
